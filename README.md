# CyanBootstrapIcons

## Cyan's Custom port of Bootstrap Icons, made to replace Lavender's Iconsax icons

### - *But Why?*

#### As Cyan is evolving as a theme, I find it crucial that it also doesn't feel like it is unfinished, and using icons from another theme that did not match the aesthetic of Cyan certainly did not help. This is why I believe the transition to a custom icon pack, namely based on Bootstrap Icons, will help separate the theme, make it feel more unique and give it character.

### - Closing words
#### Credits to Lavender-Discord (The Lavender theme), since I would have a place to begin this project if not for their amazing work on porting the Iconsax icon pack, as well as to the Bootstrap project, namely the people behind Bootstrap Icons, as this project would not exist without their amazing icons.
